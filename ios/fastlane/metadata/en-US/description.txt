The fastest way to capture and structure your thoughts: through voice.

Hold record, say what you want, and release. Just like you'd expect from an outliner, create hierarchies and rearrange. Notes are auto-transcribed and searchable, but you can always play back the audio.

Automatically attach location to notes. Remember walks you took, and which places sparked what ideas.
